# Drømtorp Aktiviteter Frontend
This is the frontend code, aka the website for a school project I have.

## What is this project?
It will be a site for viewing and joining events hosted by the school. This frontend code is the website people will visit to use this.

## Weird commit history?
Idk, maybe? ＞﹏＜ This is a school project, and my teacher wants me to commit and push my work after every class so he can see it.

## Non-english commit messages
My bad, I might sometimes forget and write them in norwegian. ¯\\(°_o)/¯ Blame my teacher for wanting them in norwegian on previous work. This is english specifically because it's a public repository.

If I do accidentally write a commit message in norwegian, I will try and at least comment on the commit what it is in english! (～﹃～)~zZ


## Why a public repository for a school project?
Because I felt like it for the most part. Use my shitty code if you want. Don't forget about the license. 

## License?
Sure buddy, look right [here](./LICENSE) ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)

It's **GPL-2.0** <sub>wow, how could you, why not MIT!1!!</sub> because I have some certain standards and self respect (not that MIT or using it is bad in any way!!!). Would be cool if there was a license like it but without the "state changes" part as I don't care about that, but oh well.

Not like this code is any great in the first place where it will be useful for someone else in a large manner.

## Why React?
The same thing I ask myself every day.

It's a fancy thing that my teacher will like me to use. Employeers also like to see you having experience with these things.

## Backend code?
You can find the [backend right here](https://github.com/TrippelZ/dromtorp-aktiviteter-backend)! ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)

Same license! Same code quality!
